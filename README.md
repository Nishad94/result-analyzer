UoP Result Analysis

This project aims to facilitate easy data storage and analysis of a college's result. The application can accept a UoP result pdf and extract essential student data automatically out of it. There will be an underlying database system that will store a student's entire academic history in the college. Data can be sorted and filtered using various criteria like a specefic subject or a set of subjects. There will be a manual mode that facilitates easy manual entry of a student's result.  


The application is made using Java, and uses MongoDB for the underlying database.
